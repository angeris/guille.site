title: About me

<img src="/images/me.jpg" alt="It's me!" style="width: 200px;" class="center"/>

BS/MS in Electrical Engineering interested in optimization, physics, and puppies; I also sometimes pretend to do research and things.

Currently working on inverse design in the [Nanoscale and Quantum Photonics Lab](nqp.stanford.edu). I also did some work in neurobiology and statistical inference in the [Brains in Silicon lab](http://web.stanford.edu/group/brainsinsilicon/index.html).

I [tweet <img src="/images/twitter.svg" alt="Tweet, tweet?" style="width: 20px;"/>](https://twitter.com/GuilleAngeris) (rarely), write some [Physics.SE](https://physics.stackexchange.com/users/26437/guillermo-angeris) and [Quora](https://www.quora.com/profile/Guillermo-Andres-Angeris) answers (occasionally), and answer my email (usually), so that's probably the best way to contact me.
